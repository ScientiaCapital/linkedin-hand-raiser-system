## OPENING (30 seconds)

> Hey [FIRST NAME],

> Saw you commented on my post about the "80% done but actually losing money" problem.

> I'm not going to pitch you. I'm just going to show you exactly what Coperniq looks like - actual software, not slides - so you can decide if it makes sense for your operation.

> Let's dive in.

---

## DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)

### Screen: Coperniq Dashboard

> So here's the scenario you mentioned: your field supervisor says "we're 80% complete" but you have no idea if you're actually profitable until month-end close.

### Navigate to: Job Profitability screen

> This is a live job right here. Let's see what's ACTUALLY happening.

### Point to: Labor hours section

> Labor estimate: 120 hours.
> Labor actual: 132 hours - that's 110% of estimate.

> But here's the thing - these aren't timecards from last week. This is hours logged THIS MORNING. Real-time.

### Point to: Materials section

> Materials estimate: $8,500.
> Materials logged in Coperniq: $8,100.
> Materials on POs not yet in QuickBooks: $2,300.

> So REAL materials are $10,400 - that's 122% of estimate.

### Point to: Margin calculation

> Original margin estimate: $8,000.
> Actual margin right now: $2,100.

> You're seeing this TODAY - not 30 days from now when you do month-end close.

### Navigate to: Job actions

> That means you can:
> 1. Throttle labor hours on this job starting tomorrow
> 2. Bill the change order you haven't invoiced yet
> 3. Have a conversation with the customer BEFORE you finish and lose more money

> Instead of getting surprised when it's too late to do anything about it.

## CONTEXTUALIZED PRICE (1 minute)

> Okay, what does this cost?

> Coperniq is $X per user per month. For a team of 15-20 people, that's about $Y per month.

> Here's what that actually means:

> If this helps you catch ONE job trending over budget and you save $5,000 by throttling labor early - it pays for itself 25x over.

> And this isn't a one-time thing. You're seeing this on every job, every day.

## HOW TO BUY (30 seconds)

> If you want to get started:

> 1. Click the link in my message
> 2. Fill out a 2-minute form - company name, team size, what software you're using now
> 3. We'll set up a demo with your actual data
> 4. Test it for 14 days, no credit card

> Questions? Just reply to this video.

> If it's not a fit, no hard feelings.

> Thanks, [FIRST NAME].

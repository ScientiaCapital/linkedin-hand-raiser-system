## OPENING (30 seconds)

> Hey [FIRST NAME],

> Saw you reacted to my post about finding out about material cost overruns after the PO is already cut.

> I'm not going to pitch you. I'm just going to show you exactly what Coperniq looks like - actual screen share, not slides - so you can decide if it makes sense for your shop.

> Let's dive in.

## DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)

### Screen: Coperniq Dashboard

> So here's the problem you mentioned: copper prices spike, your PM already ordered, and you don't find out until the invoice hits QuickBooks three weeks later.

### Navigate to: Materials Management

> See this? This is real-time supplier pricing integration.

> When your copper supplier raises prices - let's say they go from $4.50 to $5.30 per foot - Coperniq flags it THE MORNING it happens.

### Point to: Alert notification

> Your PM gets a notification right here: "Copper prices just spiked 18%. Do you still want to order for the Johnson job?"

> Now they can:
> 1. Order immediately if prices are going higher
> 2. Wait if they're stabilizing
> 3. Re-negotiate with the customer if it blows the budget

> Instead of finding out 3 weeks later when the invoice hits.

### Navigate to: Job Profitability screen

> And here's the kicker - you can see in real-time what that price change does to your margin.

> See this job here? Budget shows $12K for materials. Actual is tracking at $14K because of the spike. You're now at 83% of your original margin estimate.

> You know this TODAY - not at month-end close.

### Point to: Margin indicator

> This red flag here? That's telling you this job needs attention before you lose more money on it.

## CONTEXTUALIZED PRICE (1 minute)

> Okay, so what does this actually cost?

> Coperniq is $X per user per month. For a team of 10-15 people, that's about $Y per month total.

> Here's what that actually means:

> If this catches ONE copper price spike per month that saves you $2,000 in margin - it pays for itself 10x over.

> And you're getting real-time visibility on EVERY job, EVERY day. Not just materials - labor, change orders, everything.

> 4. You can test it with your team for 14 days - no credit card required

## OPENING (30 seconds)

> Hey [FIRST NAME],

> Saw you reacted to my post about office managers spending hours chasing timecards.

> I'm not going to pitch you. I'm just going to show you exactly what Coperniq looks like - the actual mobile app your techs would use, and what your office manager would see.

> Let's dive in.

## DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)

### Screen: Coperniq Mobile App (phone or emulator)

> First, let me show you what your field techs see.

> When they show up to a job:

### Tap through: Clock in flow

> 1. Open the app - one tap
> 2. Clock in - one tap
> 3. Select the job from the list - one tap

> That's it. 3 taps, 5 seconds. They're clocked in with GPS verification.

### Show: Material logging

> Need to log materials? Two options:

> Scan the barcode - phone camera does the work.
> Or voice-to-text - just say "50 feet of 2-inch PVC" and it logs it.

> No paper receipts getting lost in the truck. No "I forgot to write it down."

### Switch to: Desktop Dashboard

> Now here's what YOUR office manager sees.

### Navigate to: Timecard dashboard

> All timecards, automatically logged, with GPS verification, synced to QuickBooks in real-time.

> No more chasing. No more "I forgot to turn in my timecard." No more Monday morning reconciliation.

### Point to: Time saved metric

> Average office manager saves 12-15 hours per week on timecard admin.

> That's 12-15 hours she can spend:
> - Following up on $47K in unpaid invoices
> - Scheduling next week's jobs
> - Calling customers about that bathroom remodel upsell

> $25/hour admin work becomes $50/hour revenue work.

## CONTEXTUALIZED PRICE (1 minute)

> What does this cost?

> Coperniq is $X per user per month. For a team of 8-12 people, that's about $Y per month.

> Here's the real math:

> If this frees up 12 hours per week of your office manager's time, and she uses 4 of those hours to collect $10K in overdue invoices - it pays for itself 50x over.

> And your techs are clocking in from day one because it's EASIER than paper.

## Script Structure (5 minutes total)

### **OPENING (30 seconds)**
```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

Saw you [commented on / sent a DM about] my post on [specific pain point: cost overruns / labor tracking / admin burden].

I'm not going to waste your time with a sales pitch. I'm just going to show you exactly what Coperniq looks like—actual screen share, not slides—so you can decide if it makes sense for you.

Let's dive in.
```

**Why this works:**
- Personalized (uses their name + specific engagement)
- Sets expectation (no pitch, just demonstration)
- Respects their time (5 min, not 60 min)

---

### **DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)**

**For ELECTRICAL contractors (Material Cost Overruns):**
```
[Screen share: Coperniq dashboard]

So here's the problem you mentioned: finding out about cost overruns AFTER you cut the PO.

[Navigate to Materials Management screen]

See this? This is real-time supplier pricing integration. When your copper supplier raises prices—let's say they go from $X to $Y per foot—Coperniq flags it THE MORNING it happens.

[Point to alert notification]

Your PM gets a notification: "Hey, copper prices just spiked 18%. Do you still want to order for the Johnson job?"

Now they can:
1. Order immediately if prices are going up more
2. Wait if they're stabilizing
3. Re-negotiate with the customer if it blows the budget

Instead of finding out 3 weeks later when the invoice hits QuickBooks.

[Navigate to Job Profitability screen]

And here's the kicker: you can see in real-time what that price change does to your margin.

See this job here? Budget shows $12K for materials. Actual is tracking at $14K because of the spike. You're now at 83% of your original margin estimate.

You know this TODAY—not at month-end close.
```

**For HVAC contractors (Labor Burden Blindness):**
```
[Screen share: Coperniq dashboard]

You mentioned the "80% done but actually losing money" problem.

[Navigate to Job Profitability screen]

So here's a job that's supposedly 80% complete. Let's see what's ACTUALLY happening.

[Point to labor hours]
Labor estimate: 120 hours
Labor actual: 132 hours (110% of estimate)

[Point to materials]
Materials estimate: $8,500
Materials logged: $8,100 (95% of estimate)
Materials not yet in QuickBooks: $2,300 (3 POs pending)

So REAL materials are $10,400—122% of estimate.

[Point to margin calculation]
Original margin: $8,000
Actual margin (right now): $2,100

You're seeing this TODAY, not 30 days from now.

That means you can:
1. Throttle labor hours on this job
2. Bill the change order you forgot about
3. Have a conversation with the customer BEFORE you finish

Instead of getting surprised at month-end.
```

**For PLUMBING contractors (Admin Time Waste):**
```
[Screen share: Coperniq mobile app]

You mentioned your office manager spending hours chasing timecards.

[Show mobile app interface]

Here's what your field techs see. When they show up to the job:

1. Open app (1 tap)
2. Clock in (1 tap)
3. Select job from list (1 tap)

That's it. 3 taps, 5 seconds.

[Navigate to timecard dashboard]

And here's what YOUR office manager sees:

All timecards, automatically logged, with GPS verification, synced to QuickBooks in real-time.

No more chasing. No more "I forgot to turn in my timecard." No more reconciling.

[Point to time saved calculation]

Average office manager saves 12-15 hours per week on timecard admin.

That's 12-15 hours she can spend:
- Following up on $47K in unpaid invoices
- Scheduling next week's jobs
- Calling customers about that bathroom remodel upsell

$25/hour admin work → $50/hour revenue work.
```

### **CONTEXTUALIZED PRICE (1 minute)**
```
Okay, so what does this actually cost?

Coperniq is $[X] per user per month. For a team of [estimate their size: 5-10 people], that's about $[Y]/month total.

Here's what that actually means:

[For Electrical contractors:]
If this catches ONE copper price spike per month that saves you $2,000 in margin—it pays for itself 10x over.

[For HVAC contractors:]
If this helps you catch ONE job trending over budget and you save $5,000 by throttling labor early—it pays for itself 25x over.

[For Plumbing contractors:]
If this frees up 12 hours per week of your office manager's time, and she uses 4 of those hours to collect $10K in overdue invoices—it pays for itself 50x over.

And you're getting real-time visibility on EVERY job, EVERY day.

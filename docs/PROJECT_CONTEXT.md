# Project Context - LinkedIn Hand-Raiser System

## Company: Coperniq

### What Coperniq Does
Coperniq is a B2B SaaS platform that provides **real-time job profitability visibility** for trade contractors (MEP+E). It solves the "month-end surprise" problem where contractors don't know if they're profitable on a job until 30+ days after completion.

### Core Value Propositions
1. **Real-time material cost tracking** - Know when supplier prices change before you cut the PO
2. **Live labor burden calculation** - See actual vs estimated labor hours while the job is in progress
3. **Automated timecard collection** - Mobile app eliminates manual timecard chasing
4. **QuickBooks integration** - Auto-sync eliminates duplicate data entry

## Competitive Landscape

### Main Competitors
- **ServiceTitan** - Enterprise, expensive, overkill for mid-market
- **Jobber** - Good for service, weak on construction/project costing
- **Procore** - Construction-focused but expensive and complex

## LinkedIn Strategy Context

### Why LinkedIn for MEP Contractors?
- 80%+ of MEP contractor owners/decision-makers are on LinkedIn
- Trade publications and industry groups are active on LinkedIn
- Lower competition than Google Ads for this niche
- Content can demonstrate expertise (vs. just selling)

### Hand-Raiser Strategy
**Goal:** Replace cold outreach with high-intent inbound leads

**Mechanism:**
1. Post content that surfaces a **specific pain point**
2. Offer a **promise** (video, audit, checklist) to those who engage
3. **Qualify** through engagement type (comment = public commitment, DM = private interest)
4. Respond with **5-minute async video** (not 60-min discovery call)
5. Convert video viewers to **demo bookings**

### Content Pillars
1. **Pain Point Posts** - Surface specific problems (material costs, labor burden, admin waste)
2. **Educational Posts** - Teach something useful (even if they don't buy)
3. **Case Studies** - Social proof from similar contractors
4. **Polls/Surveys** - Engagement bait + market research

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Tone for LinkedIn
- **Direct** - No fluff, contractors don't have time for it
- **Practical** - Real numbers, real examples, real outcomes
- **Empathetic** - We understand the pain (not preachy)
- **Confident** - We know this works (but not arrogant)

### Words to Use
- "Real-time" (not "visibility solution")
- "Margin" (not "profitability optimization")
- "Before month-end" (specific timing)
- "3 minutes" (specific numbers beat vague claims)

### Words to Avoid
- "Synergy," "leverage," "optimize"
- "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "best-in-class"
- Anything that sounds like enterprise software marketing

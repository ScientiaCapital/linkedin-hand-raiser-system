# Planning & Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-07

## Current Sprint: Week 1 - Foundation

### Sprint Goal
Set up the complete hand-raiser system infrastructure and publish first test posts.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Tracking Method:** Excel-based (local control, full formulas)

3. **Automation Level:** Light (scripts for data formatting, not posting)
4. **Target Verticals:** Electrical, HVAC, Plumbing (3 parallel tracks)

## Strategy Overview

### Hand-Raiser Post Formula
1. **Hook** - Pattern interrupt with pain point
2. **Promise** - "If [condition], I'll send you [specific deliverable]"
3. **Qualifier** - Filter for ideal prospects
4. **Call to Action** - Comment/DM with specific keyword

### Response Protocol
1. Prospect comments/DMs → within 24 hours
2. Send personalized 5-min Loom video
3. End with clear CTA to book demo
4. Track in Response Tracker tab

### Pain Points to Test (Priority Order)
1. **Material Cost Overruns** - Copper/steel price volatility
2. **Labor Burden Blindness** - Hidden costs in burdened rates
3. **Admin Time Waste** - Office manager drowning in paperwork
4. **Cash Flow Delays** - Slow invoicing killing margins
5. **Job Profitability Opacity** - Can't see profit until job ends

## Experiments to Run

### A/B Test Ideas
1. **Hook Style:** Question vs Statement vs Statistic
2. **Promise Type:** Free audit vs Checklist vs Video
3. **CTA Format:** Comment keyword vs DM request
4. **Post Length:** Short (under 150 words) vs Long (300+ words)

### Current Hypothesis
> MEP contractors in the Electrical vertical will have highest engagement on "Material Cost Overruns" pain point due to copper price volatility.

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Low engagement risk:** Have backup pain points ready to test
2. **Overwhelmed with DMs:** Use video template for consistent response
3. **Wrong vertical:** Data will show clearly in Week 2 dashboard

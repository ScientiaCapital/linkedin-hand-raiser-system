## Template 1: Electrical Contractors (Material Cost Overruns)
```
Question for electrical contractors:

How often do you find out about a material cost overrun AFTER you've already cut the PO?

You budgeted $12K for wire and conduit on a job.
Your PM ordered it.
Then you find out copper prices spiked 18% last week.
Now it's $14K and your margin just disappeared.

But you don't find out until the invoice hits QuickBooks—3 weeks later.

What if you knew the MORNING your supplier raised prices—before your PM placed the order?

Drop a 👍 if this has happened to you in the last 90 days.

## Template 2: HVAC Contractors (Labor Burden Blindness)
```
HVAC contractors: honest question.

When your field supervisor says "we're 80% done with that job"—do you actually KNOW if you're profitable yet?

Here's what I see happen constantly:

Your PM thinks: "80% complete, we're on budget, we're good."

Reality check:
→ Labor hours are 110% of estimate (but timecards aren't in yet)
→ Materials are 95% of budget (but 3 POs haven't hit QuickBooks)
→ Change orders aren't fully billed yet

You think you're making $8K on the job.
You actually made $2K.
But you don't find out until month-end close.

What if you knew your ACTUAL profit margin TODAY—not 30 days from now?

Comment "yes" if you've ever been shocked by how little you made on a "profitable" job.

## Template 3: Plumbing Contractors (Admin Time Waste)
```
Plumbing contractors: be honest.

How much time does your office manager spend chasing field techs for:
→ Timecards that should've been submitted Monday
→ Material receipts that got "lost in the truck"
→ Job notes that are still in someone's head

And then reconciling all of it in QuickBooks before you can invoice?

Here's the hidden cost nobody talks about:

While your office manager is playing timecard detective, she's NOT:
→ Following up on unpaid invoices
→ Scheduling next week's jobs
→ Calling customers for upsell opportunities

You're paying her $25/hour to do $15/hour data entry work—instead of $50/hour revenue-generating work.

What if your field techs clocked in/out from their phone, logged materials on-site, and everything auto-synced to QuickBooks WITHOUT your office manager touching it?

React with 🔥 if your office manager deserves better than timecard duty.

## Response Protocol

When someone engages (comment/DM), use this response template:
```
That's exactly what we built Coperniq to solve. Let me send you a quick 5-min video showing how we [catch those price changes / track real profitability / automate timecard collection]—before [PMs cut POs / month-end close / your office manager wastes another hour].

No sales pitch, just a screen share of what it looks like. Sound good?
```

**Then:** Send Loom video via DM (use scripts from `/videos` folder)

---

## Testing Protocol

1. **Post Mon/Wed/Fri 8am PST** (optimal contractor engagement time)
2. **Track engagement in Excel** within 24 hours
3. **Respond to all DMs** within 2 hours
4. **Weekly review Monday 9am** - analyze what's working
5. **Iterate on lowest-performing angles** - test refined versions

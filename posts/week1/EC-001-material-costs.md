```
Question for electrical contractors:

How often do you find out about a material cost overrun AFTER you've already cut the PO?

You budgeted $12K for wire and conduit on a job.
Your PM ordered it.
Then you find out copper prices spiked 18% last week.
Now it's $14K and your margin just disappeared.

But you don't find out until the invoice hits QuickBooks—3 weeks later.

What if you knew the MORNING your supplier raised prices—before your PM placed the order?

Drop a 👍 if this has happened to you in the last 90 days.

Plumbing contractors: be honest.

How much time does your office manager spend chasing field techs for:
→ Timecards that should've been submitted Monday
→ Material receipts that got "lost in the truck"
→ Job notes that are still in someone's head

And then reconciling all of it in QuickBooks before you can invoice?

Here's the hidden cost nobody talks about:

While your office manager is playing timecard detective, she's NOT:
→ Following up on unpaid invoices
→ Scheduling next week's jobs
→ Calling customers for upsell opportunities

You're paying her $25/hour to do $15/hour data entry work—instead of $50/hour revenue-generating work.

What if your field techs clocked in/out from their phone, logged materials on-site, and everything auto-synced to QuickBooks WITHOUT your office manager touching it?

React with 🔥 if your office manager deserves better than timecard duty.

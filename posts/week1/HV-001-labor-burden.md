HVAC contractors: honest question.

When your field supervisor says "we're 80% done with that job"—do you actually KNOW if you're profitable yet?

Here's what I see happen constantly:

Your PM thinks: "80% complete, we're on budget, we're good."

Reality check:
→ Labor hours are 110% of estimate (but timecards aren't in yet)
→ Materials are 95% of budget (but 3 POs haven't hit QuickBooks)
→ Change orders aren't fully billed yet

You think you're making $8K on the job.
You actually made $2K.
But you don't find out until month-end close.

What if you knew your ACTUAL profit margin TODAY—not 30 days from now?

Comment "yes" if you've ever been shocked by how little you made on a "profitable" job.

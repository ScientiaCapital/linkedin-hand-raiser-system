# LinkedIn Response Scripts

## Standard Hand-Raiser Response

Use this when someone comments with 👍, 🔥, "yes", or any positive engagement:

```
That's exactly what we built Coperniq to solve. Let me send you a quick 5-min video showing how we [catch those price changes / track real profitability / automate timecard collection]—before [PMs cut POs / month-end close / your office manager wastes another hour].

No sales pitch, just a screen share of what it looks like. Sound good?
```

**Customize the bracketed sections based on which post they engaged with:**
- EC posts → "catch those price changes" + "PMs cut POs"
- HV posts → "track real profitability" + "month-end close"
- PL posts → "automate timecard collection" + "your office manager wastes another hour"

## Objection Handlers

### "We use [Competitor] and still have this problem"

```
Yeah, I hear that a lot. Most tools show you HISTORICAL data—what happened last week or last month.

Coperniq shows you TODAY's data: labor hours logged THIS MORNING, materials ordered THIS WEEK, current vs. budget in real-time.

Want to see the difference? I'll send a quick 5-min screen share—no obligation, just want to show you what real-time tracking actually looks like.
```

### "My guys won't use their phones for work stuff"

```
Totally fair concern—and that's exactly why we built the mobile app to be stupidly simple.

Clock in/out: 2 taps (literally opens, tap clock-in, done)
Log materials: Scan barcode or voice-to-text

Most crews are using it within 48 hours because it's EASIER than paper timecards.

Want to see a 2-min video of the mobile app? I can show you what your techs would actually see. No sales pitch, just the UX walkthrough.
```

### "What does it cost?"

```
Depends on team size, but for most contractors in the 10-50 person range, we're talking $X-Y per user per month.

The real question is: what's ONE cost overrun or ONE late invoice costing you per month?

If Coperniq catches even one $2,000 margin leak per month, it pays for itself 10x over.

Want me to send a quick video showing what that actually looks like in the software? Then you can decide if the math makes sense for your team.
```

---

### "We're too busy to implement new software"

```
Totally get it—implementation fatigue is real.

Here's what's different about Coperniq: your techs are up and running in 48 hours, not 48 days. It's 3 taps to clock in. No training manuals.

And it syncs to QuickBooks automatically—so your office manager isn't learning a new system, she's just getting cleaner data.

Want to see a 5-min walkthrough? If it looks like too much hassle, no hard feelings. But most people are surprised how light the lift is.
```

### "Send me more info" (low-intent deflection)

```
Happy to—but honestly, a 5-min video will show you more than any PDF ever could.

I'll record a quick screen share showing exactly how [specific pain point they engaged with] works in Coperniq. You can watch it whenever, skip around, share with your team.

Sound good? Or would you prefer I just send a one-pager?

## DM After Sending Video

```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

Here's the 5-min video I mentioned: [LOOM LINK]

Shows exactly how [specific outcome from their pain point] works in Coperniq.

No obligation—just want to give you the info so you can decide if it makes sense.

If you want to test it with your team, there's a link in the video. Otherwise, no worries.

## Follow-Up (If No Response After 48 Hours)

```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

Just wanted to make sure that video landed. Did you get a chance to watch it?

If it's not a fit, totally fine—just let me know and I won't follow up again.

But if you're curious about [one specific feature that matches their pain point], happy to answer any questions.

- Tim
```
